See here for a sample syllabus: [Math 13X Sample Syllabus](../../misc/SampleSyllabus-Math13X.pdf)

Math 13X, *Skills for Success in Abstract Math*, is a new course that is planned to be taught in Fall 2025 for the first time.  All Math 13X students are required to be simultaneously enrolled in Math 13 (but not vice versa).  This course was developed in collaboration with Alessandra Pantano and Marissa Corr, through the Math Department's *Inclusive Excellence* committee.  If the course is successful, we hope to teach it regularly during the following academic year (Fall 2026 and beyond).
